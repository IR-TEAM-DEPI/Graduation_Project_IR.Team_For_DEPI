## 🧭 Overview

Week 4 represents the **Final Phase** of our project —  
where we validate all remediation actions completed in Week 3, perform follow-up scans using **Nessus**, and compile the **Final Security Report**.

The goal is to confirm that:
- All high-risk vulnerabilities were remediated 🔐  
- System risk is significantly reduced 📉  
- The infrastructure is ready for production confidence 🏗️  

> 🧠 *In cybersecurity, verification is where theory meets results.*
